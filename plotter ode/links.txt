SlrR/SlrA controls the initiation of biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis  


SlrR (formerly Slr) and SlrA are homologues of
SinR and SinI respectively, and SlrR/SlrA represses
sD-dependent flagellar genes and activate the eps and
yqxM operons.

In the ywcC mutant, SlrR/SlrA rather than
SinI activates the eps and yqxM operons by antagoniz-
ing SinR.

 cell-wall autolysins, the latter of which are required to
maintain a uniform cell length.

Because an
abrB mutation can bypass the requirement of Spo0A for
biofilm formation, repression of abrB transcription seems
to be the major role for Spo0A~P in biofilm formation

AbrB is abundant during
the early growth phase, and it represses transcription of
many genes that are active in the stationary phase.


binding of SinI inhibits the DNA-
binding activity of SinR

the control of SinR activity is thought to govern
the switch from planktonic to biofilm-forming growth mode

Here we report that a complex of the SinR and SlrR proteins binds to and
represses genes involved in cell separation and motility.

We also report that SinR and SlrR constitute a double-
negative feedback loop in which SinR represses the gene for SlrR (slrR), and, by binding to (titrating) SinR, SlrR
prevents SinR from repressing slrR. Thus, SlrR indirectly derepresses its own gene, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
Finally, we show that, once activated, the loop remains locked in a high SlrR state in which cell separation
and motility genes are OFF for extended periods of time.

A second circumstance in which chaining is observed
is in structured communities called biofilms

 Biofilms consist of long chains of
cells that are attached to each other along their long axes
by an extracellular matrix 

SinI is an anti-repressor that binds to and
inhibits the SinR repressor, a protein that is produced
constitutively 

We report that SinR and SlrR constitute a double-
negative feedback loop involving protein–protein (SlrR-
mediated inhibition of SinR) and protein–DNA (SinR-
mediated repression of slrR) interactions.

SlrR binds to SinR, and that the formation of the
SinR•SlrR complex inhibits the capacity of SinR to bind to the slrR promoter (and other SinR targets)


At the same
time, the SinR•SlrR complex, but neither SinR alone
nor SlrR alone, is a potent repressor of autolysin genes

We
propose that the SinR SlrR switch exists in two alterna-
tive stable states: a state in which SlrR levels are high
(SlrR HIGH state), and a state in which SlrR levels are
low (SlrR LOW state)

Five histidine kinases with partially overlap-
ping functions mediate the phosphorylation of Spo0A. Four of these
(KinA, KinB, KinC, KinD) are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane

The cues triggering
biofilm formation are not completely understood, but KinC plays an
import role in this process. [57,60,61] Its kinase activity is regulated by
surfactin, a motility-related lipopeptide produced by B. subtilis and also
other bacteria

SinR, when expressed in the absence of antagonists, must first
form the SinR tetramer before binding and repressing the activity of the nearby tapA-sipW-tasA

Pull-down experiments using a tagged
version of SlrA established that it is able
to interact with both SinR and SlrR operon. 


Using a
combination of surface plasmon reso-
nance and isothermal titration calorim-
etry, a high affinity interaction between
SlrA and SinR but not between SlrA and
SlrR 10 was found

It has been established that SlrR is sub-
ject to degradation in vivo, appearing to
degrade proteolytically with a half-life of
approximately 100 min

In a population, individual cells grow at different rates, and KinC would increase the Spo0A activity in the fast-growing cells but reduce the Spo0A activity in the slow-growing cells. This mechanism reduces single-cell heterogeneity of Spo0A activity, thereby increasing the fraction of cells that activate biofilm matrix production. Thus, KinC activates biofilm formation by controlling the fraction of cells activating biofilm gene expression.

Molecular Basis of the Activity of SinR Protein, the Master
Regulator of Biofilm Formation in Bacillus subtilis


When suffi-
cient SinI is present, an SinR-SinI complex is formed that inhib-
its the SinR-DNA interaction, causing derepression (13, 14),
brought about not by the occlusion of the DNA binding sites in
SinR by SinI, but by the dissociation of the SinR tetramer into a
SinR-SinI heterodimer

SlrR binds to SinR, and this com-
plex represses genes involved in flagellar biosynthesis and cell
separation


 A, thermodynamics of the SinR-SinI interaction measured by ITC. Sequential injections of SinI
(516
M ) were performed into a reaction cell containing SinR (38
M ). Both the raw data (upper panel) and the integrated heats (lower panel) show a sudden
sharp transition, indicating that the interaction is too tight to be accurately measured by ITC (Kd 10 n M ).


The lack of intermediate points on the binding isotherm means
that the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) cannot be deter-
mined accurately, suggesting that the SinR-SinI and the SinR-
SlrA interactions are too tight to be measured directly by ITC
(upper limit for Kd 10 n M ). However, some thermodynamic
parameters (Table 1) are directly obtained from the isotherms
such as the binding enthalpy, H, and the interaction stoichi-
ometry, n. The fact that SinI and SinR form a very tight complex
with 1:1 stoichiometry was not surprising given the previous
data on this interaction (

sinR encodes a tetrameric repressor of genes required for biofilm formation in Bacillus subtilis

sinI, which is transcribed under Spo0A control, encodes a dimeric protein that binds to SinR to form a SinR–SinI heterodimer in which the DNA-binding functions of SinR are abrogated and repression of biofilm genes is relieved

The SinI-SinR interaction is essentially irreversible, creating a dead-end complex [23] as
established by the very low binding affinity and very slow dissociation rate 

The
formation of this dead-end inhibitory complex is proposed to be necessary for sequestering
free SinR thereby ensuring biofilm formation 

we provide the first structures of both full-length tetrameric SinR and dimeric
SinI in solution.


Previous studies suggest that SinR is a tetramer in solution.


It is also known that SinI is in monomer/dimer equilibrium, and
that the SinR-SinI complex is a heterodimer.

SinI adopts a clear
dimeric state


In solution, SinI is in a rapidly reversible monomer/dimer
equilibrium

Tetrameric SinRC is formed by a dimer of dimers through helical hooks
